# 2019-Polar-Vortex
Visualization of 2019 polar vortex and North American Cold Wave through use of GFS Geopotential Height Data.

This is a JavaScript written visualization of how the 2019 Polar Vortex created the 2019 North American Cold Wave which was one of the coldest and deadliest of its kind. This visualization technique was largely developed by Nico Belmonte in Chapter Nine of the textbook WebGL insights http://www.webglinsights.com/. Much of this technique was then altered by me, so the two should no longer be used interchangeably.
